# Foundry

Foundry is a modern platform framework that helps developers structure, generate, and orchestrate full-stack applications using a single declarative manifest: **`platform.foundry`**.

Instead of hand-crafting complex monorepo setups, workspace structures, or build pipelines, Foundry provides a cohesive, opinionated foundation that defines your entire platform in one place.
